You should be looking at a folder with all the necessary libs ready.
If you don't have them (or are just curious) here's where they're from:

Needed references:
- yourgamepath/BepInEx/core
	- dll files only

- yourgamepath/WizardofLegend_data/managed/
	- Unityengine.dll
	- UnityEngine.UI.dll

- publicized Assembly-CSharp.dll
	- follow some resource on how to publicize with reins tool
	- if there is nothing linked here timesweeper forgot to add it ping him and call him silly names. 

- MMHOOK.dll
	- run the game once, and hookgenpatcher will generate an MMHOOK file. It will be in your BepInEx/Plugins folder
